- When creating a gateway, what happens if you already have a gateway / token???
----> gateways can be duplicated per merchant, so we probably need to have some constraints,
      e.g between `merchant and gateway_type`
- In gateways credentials response, we use the `credentials.safe property` to check if the input should be of type `text` or `password`
- Can a merchant support multiple gateways?
- Support multiple authorisation modes i.e. paypal..
